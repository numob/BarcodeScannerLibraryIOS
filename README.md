## BarcodeScannerView Class

A class that incorporates custom logic for selecting and returning barcodes recognized from `DataScannerViewController`.

- **recognizedItem**: (from `DataScannerViewController` item)
- **containsTarget**: A bool reference that is returned from this class on whether or not the recognized item includes the target (crosshair plus icon).
- **isTargetVisible**: A bool reference that sets the target (center indicated by plus symbol) visible or not.
- **focusedViewWidth** and **focusedViewHeight**: Set the dimensions of the focused view, which is a view that restricts the recognized items within the view; optional.

### Example:
```swift
BarcodeScannerView(
    recognizedItem: $recognizedItem, 
    containsTarget: $containsTarget, 
    isTargetVisible: $target, 
    focusedViewWidth: 200, 
    focusedViewHeight: 200
)
BarcodeScannerView(
    recognizedItem: $recognizedItem, 
    containsTarget: $containsTarget, 
    isTargetVisible: $target
)
